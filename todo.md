TO DO

OK lets redesign the provider cards on the search page. Right now each one takes too much space and has some details that arent necessary right now. 

Details to show:
- Name
- Locaton (show city and state) (If they have additional locations show a pill that says "{X} more locations"
- Distance (Only if the visitors location is provided in the search)
- Tags for In Home and In Center
- Insurance (list up to 3 and put and "{X} more") (If visitor selected an insurance in the search results, put a green pill for "In Network with {Insurance}" with a check mark instead of listing the insurances)
- Short description
- Button to View Provider

Featured companies also have "Featured" badge, a light yellow background.
